# **First Github Markdown File**
### *Repository*
I learned how to create a repository on github and learned on all of its uses. A repository is nothing but a project folder.
#####
>I also learned all the github terms like
- Branching
  - Forks
    - * *Cloning* *
      - **Commiting and Pushing**
        - ***Pull requests***
          - ~~Issues~~
#####
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

Course Review:
- In my view, course is good. But i find it a little bit fast-paced for myself.
- I find the usage of technologies for this course a little confusing. Little help with it during class is appreciated.
